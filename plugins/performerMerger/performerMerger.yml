# This plugin searches for all performers tagged "Merge From Performer" and merges them
# into a performer tagged "Merge Into Performer". If more than one performer is tagged
# with the second tag, the merge is aborted.
#
# Details default to the destination performer, but gaps will be filled by source
# performers as applicable. For example if both the destination and source list a
# date of birth, then the destination DOB is preserved. However, if more the
# destination does not include a DOB then it will be taken from the source. If more
# than one source has the DOB, then it is undefined which performer info will be used.
#
# Scenes, galleries, and images of source performer(s) will be updated to the destination
# performer, details and tags will be merged, and then the source performer(s) will be
# deleted.
