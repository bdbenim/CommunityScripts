This plugin searches for all images with a performer count of 0 and sets their performers to be the same as their parent
gallery/galleries if the galleries have any performers.

Any images that are marked as organized or that already have 1 or more performers will be ignored, even if their gallery
has more performers, since these are assumed to be already organized.
