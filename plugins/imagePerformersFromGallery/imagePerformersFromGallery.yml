# This plugin searches for all images with a performer count of 0 and sets their performers
# to be the same as their parent gallery/galleries if the galleries have any performers.
#
# Any images that already have 1 or more performers will be ignored, even if their gallery
# has more performers, since these are assumed to be already organized. This can be
# overridden by creating a tag called "Update Performers" and applying it to images that
# you want to force an update on.
#
# Changes can be limited to specific galleries by applying the same "Update Performers"
# tag to them and running the "Tagged Galleries" task. Images not in these galleries
# will be ignored (even if they also have the "Update Performers" tag)
