# This plugin searches for all images with a performer count of 0 and sets their performers
# to be the same as their parent gallery/galleries if the galleries have any performers.
#
# Any images that already have 1 or more performers will be ignored, even if their gallery
# has more performers, since these are assumed to be already organized.
